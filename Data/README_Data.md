## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This document provides detailed information about the **three single-cell RNA sequencing files** from the **PC9 Erlotinib Resistance Study**.  
This dataset is a valuable resource for understanding drug resistance mechanisms in **non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)** at the single-cell level.

---

## ðŸ§ª Key Dataset Information

- **Study Context**  
  The dataset investigates how **PC9 lung adenocarcinoma cells** develop resistance to **erlotinib**, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, over an **11-day treatment period**.  
  This research addresses a critical clinical problem: while patients initially respond to erlotinib, they often develop resistance after **10â€“14 months** of treatment.

- **Technology Used**  
  The study uses **Drop-seq**, a high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing platform that:
  - Encapsulates individual cells into nanoliter droplets  
  - Tags transcripts with **unique barcodes** for cell-of-origin tracking  
  - Maintains high-throughput capabilities for thousands of cells
