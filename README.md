# scRNAseq-Erlotinib-Response
This repository contains a complete analysis pipeline for studying the transcriptional response of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to Erlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

The analysis includes:

📊 Preprocessing of raw gene expression matrices

🔍 Differential gene expression analysis between treated and control conditions

🧠 Biological interpretation focusing on drug resistance mechanisms

🧬 Integration of results with known EGFR pathways and oncogenic markers
